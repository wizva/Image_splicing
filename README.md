# Image_splicing
This project provides an efficient and reliable image splicing detection solution implemented in Python, utilizing the CASIA v2.0 dataset. Image splicing refers to the malicious act of combining multiple images to create a misleading or deceptive composite image.

The CASIA v2.0 dataset, one of the most widely used datasets for image forensics, comprises authentic and manipulated images that facilitate the development of robust splicing detection algorithms. This project harnesses the power of CASIA v2.0 to develop an accurate and automated image splicing detection system.

Using this codebase, users can employ advanced image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to detect signs of image splicing. The Python implementation enables seamless integration into existing workflows and provides a user-friendly interface for executing the splicing detection process.
